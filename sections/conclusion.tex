At this stage of this Work-in-Progress, we examined the feasibility of multi-level preemption in ethernet networks and provided a set of recommendations. Now, we seek to develop a formal worst case transmission delay analysis of frames assuming multi-level preemption and conduct experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness in time sensitive ethernet networks. An improvement is expected for medium priority frames with affordable preemption overhead in terms of buffer size and SMD definitions.

%A more stable behaviour of express frames is also expected under TSN as having more than one preemption level ensures better QoS for AV traffic.
