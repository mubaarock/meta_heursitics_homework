Given the set of elements $A = \{a_1, a_2,….a_n \}$, and set of subsets $F = \{A_1, . . . , A_n\}$ such that $A_i \subseteq A$ and covers, a weight function $w: F\rightarrow R^+$, cost value for subsets of $F$, the objective is to find $C^*$ that covers all items of A with minimal total weight i.e., 
%$C^* ∈ arg minC′∈Covers(A,F) w(C′)$
%Where$ w(C^′)$ is defined as $ƩA′∈C′ w(A′)$
