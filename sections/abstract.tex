The IEEE Time Sensitive Networking group is developing a new set of standards to introduce real-time features to Ethernet. Networks conforming to these standards are referred to as Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). An open area in TSN is routing. Recent works in literature have proposed routing algorithms to meet the needs of TSN networks. To the best of our knowledge, however, none of these algorithms have considered self reconfiguration under transient overload conditions in TSN networks. In this work, we propose a Tabu Search based algorithm for online self reconfiguration and load-balancing in TSN networks under transient overload conditions.
